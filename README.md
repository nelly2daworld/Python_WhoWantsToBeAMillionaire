Who wants to be a Millionaire?
The hit TV show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" is a game show that uses a basic rule set: answer a multiple choice question correctly, get more money. Your goal is to recreate a shorter version of the game with 8 questions. 

Before the game starts, prompt the user for their name.

Before each round, the game should tell the user how much money they have currently made. Store the amount of money they have made in a variable. Then you should present the question on one line and the four multiple choice options on seperate lines. Prompt the user for the answer with ">>". Your program should look like the following (user input is in bold):

Welcome to Millionaire! What is your name? Daniel

Currently you have made $0.

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest summit on which continent?

a. Asia

b. Africa

c. Europe

d. Australia

>> b

Correct!

Currently you have made $500.

Which NBA team has won the most championships?

a. Boston Celtics

b. Los Angeles Lakers

c. Golden State Warriors

d. Chicago Bulls

>> a

Correct!

Currently you have made $1000.

Which Drake album came out first chronologically?

a. Thank Me Later

b. Scorpion

c. Views

d. Nothing was the Same

>> b

I'm sorry, that is incorrect.


You can make up the questions to be on any topic(s) you want, but there should be eight in total.

If a user does get all eight questions correct, you should congratulate the user and tell them "You are a millionaire!".

If you need inspiration for questions, you can take some from the official Who Wants to be a Millionaire test or this questions archive. In the file answers.txt, input the correct answers on seperate lines like this (for example, you can put in whatever the correct answers actually are):

b

a

a

d

a

d

c

b

answers.txt will only be read during the test, so that each test knows what to put in for a "correct" answer, or an "incorrect" answer.
